In consideration of the Company’s agreement to provide the Services through the Company’s third party providers, I do here now and forever release and discharge and hereby hold harmless the Company and their third party providers, respective agents, heirs, assigns, contractors, and employees from any and all claims, demands, damages, rights of action or causes of action, present or future, arising out of or connected with the Services and/or my participation in this or any exercise program including any injuries resulting there from.
 
THIS WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INJURIES WHICH MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF (1) EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OR TO MYSELF THAT MAY MALFUNCTION OR BREAK; (2) ANY SLIP, FALL, DROPPING OF EQUIPMENT; (3) AND/OR NEGLIGENT INSTRUCTION OR SUPERVISION.
 
I am aware that there are significant risks involved in all aspects of physical training whether or not requiring the use of exercise equipment. These risks include, but are not limited to: falls which can result in serious injury or death; injury or death due to negligence on the part of myself, my personal trainer, or other people around me; strains and sprains; abnormal changes in blood pressure, fainting, and a remote risk of heart attack, stroke, other serious disability or death. I am voluntarily participating in these activities and using equipment with full knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the dangers involved. I am aware that any of these above mentioned risks may result in serious injury or death to myself and or my partner(s). I willingly assume full responsibility for the risks that I am exposing myself to and accept full responsibility for any injury or death that may result from participation in any activity or Service provided by the Company through its third party providers. 
 
I have been advised that an examination by a physician should be obtained by anyone prior to commencing a fitness and/or exercise program, or initiating a substantial change in the amount of regular physical activity performed. If I have chosen not to obtain a physician’s consent prior to beginning this fitness program with the Company’s third party providers, I hereby agree that I am doing so solely at my own risk. In any event, I acknowledge and agree that I assume the risks associated with any and all fitness related activities and/or exercises in which I participate.
 
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE NO PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT, INJURIES, OR ILLNESSES THAT WILL ENDANGER MYSELF OR OTHERS. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE THOROUGHLY READ THIS FORM IN ITS ENTIRETY AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A RELEASE OF LIABILITY. BY THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, I ACCEPT AND ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY AND ALL INJURIES, DAMAGES (BOTH ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC), AND LOSSES OF ANY TYPE, WHICH MAY OCCUR TO ME OR MY GUEST, AND HEREBY FULLY AND FOREVER RELEASE AND DISCHARGE THE COMPANY, ITS INSURERS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND ASSOCIATES, FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, RIGHTS OF ACTION, OR CAUSES OF ACTION, PRESENT OR FUTURE, WHETHER THE SAME BE KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ANTICIPATED, OR UNANTICIPATED, RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF SAID SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY OR ITS THRID PARTY PROVIDERS.
 
This form is an important legal document that explains the risks you are assuming by beginning an exercise program. It is critical that you have read and understand this document completely. If you do not understand any part of this document, it is your ultimate responsibility to ask for clarification prior to participating in the Services.

USER PROVIDED CONTENT.
WeTrain may, in WeTrain’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to WeTrain through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions ("User Content"). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to WeTrain, you grant WeTrain a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and WeTrain’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.
 
You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant WeTrain the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor WeTrain’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
 
You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by WeTrain in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. WeTrain may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at WeTrain’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.

Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. WeTrain does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.
 
4. PAYMENT
 
You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, WeTrain will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by WeTrain. 
 
All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by WeTrain using the preferred payment method designated in your Account. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that WeTrain may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
 
As between you and WeTrain, WeTrain reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in WeTrain’s sole discretion. WeTrain may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. WeTrain does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by WeTrain to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that WeTrain provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.

6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
 
ARBITRATION.
You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration between you and WeTrain, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and WeTrain are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and WeTrain otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.
 
ARBITRATION RULES AND GOVERNING LAW.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
 
ARBITRATION PROCESS.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Pennsylvania and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
 
ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE.
Unless you and WeTrain otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and WeTrain submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 
ARBITRATOR'S DECISION.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. WeTrain will not seek, and hereby waives all rights WeTrain may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if WeTrain prevails in arbitration.
 
FEES.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, WeTrain will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
 
CHANGES.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if WeTrain changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing WeTrain written notice of such rejection by email from the email address associated with your Account to support@wetrainphilly.com within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last update" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and WeTrain in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

In consideration of the Company’s agreement to provide the Services through the Company’s third party providers, I do here now and forever release and discharge and hereby hold harmless the Company and their third party providers, respective agents, heirs, assigns, contractors, and employees from any and all claims, demands, damages, rights of action or causes of action, present or future, arising out of or connected with the Services and/or my participation in this or any exercise program including any injuries resulting there from.
 
THIS WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INJURIES WHICH MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF (1) EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OR TO MYSELF THAT MAY MALFUNCTION OR BREAK; (2) ANY SLIP, FALL, DROPPING OF EQUIPMENT; (3) AND/OR NEGLIGENT INSTRUCTION OR SUPERVISION.
 
I am aware that there are significant risks involved in all aspects of physical training whether or not requiring the use of exercise equipment. These risks include, but are not limited to: falls which can result in serious injury or death; injury or death due to negligence on the part of myself, my personal trainer, or other people around me; strains and sprains; abnormal changes in blood pressure, fainting, and a remote risk of heart attack, stroke, other serious disability or death. I am voluntarily participating in these activities and using equipment with full knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the dangers involved. I am aware that any of these above mentioned risks may result in serious injury or death to myself and or my partner(s). I willingly assume full responsibility for the risks that I am exposing myself to and accept full responsibility for any injury or death that may result from participation in any activity or Service provided by the Company through its third party providers. 
 
I have been advised that an examination by a physician should be obtained by anyone prior to commencing a fitness and/or exercise program, or initiating a substantial change in the amount of regular physical activity performed. If I have chosen not to obtain a physician’s consent prior to beginning this fitness program with the Company’s third party providers, I hereby agree that I am doing so solely at my own risk. In any event, I acknowledge and agree that I assume the risks associated with any and all fitness related activities and/or exercises in which I participate.
 
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE NO PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT, INJURIES, OR ILLNESSES THAT WILL ENDANGER MYSELF OR OTHERS. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE THOROUGHLY READ THIS FORM IN ITS ENTIRETY AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A RELEASE OF LIABILITY. BY THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, I ACCEPT AND ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY AND ALL INJURIES, DAMAGES (BOTH ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC), AND LOSSES OF ANY TYPE, WHICH MAY OCCUR TO ME OR MY GUEST, AND HEREBY FULLY AND FOREVER RELEASE AND DISCHARGE THE COMPANY, ITS INSURERS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND ASSOCIATES, FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, RIGHTS OF ACTION, OR CAUSES OF ACTION, PRESENT OR FUTURE, WHETHER THE SAME BE KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ANTICIPATED, OR UNANTICIPATED, RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF SAID SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY OR ITS THRID PARTY PROVIDERS.
 
This form is an important legal document that explains the risks you are assuming by beginning an exercise program. It is critical that you have read and understand this document completely. If you do not understand any part of this document, it is your ultimate responsibility to ask for clarification prior to participating in the Services.

USER PROVIDED CONTENT.
WeTrain may, in WeTrain’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to WeTrain through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions ("User Content"). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to WeTrain, you grant WeTrain a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and WeTrain’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.
 
You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant WeTrain the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor WeTrain’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

4. PAYMENT
 
You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, WeTrain will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by WeTrain. 
 
All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by WeTrain using the preferred payment method designated in your Account. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that WeTrain may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
 
As between you and WeTrain, WeTrain reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in WeTrain’s sole discretion. WeTrain may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. WeTrain does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by WeTrain to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that WeTrain provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.

6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
 
ARBITRATION.
You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration between you and WeTrain, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and WeTrain are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and WeTrain otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.
 
ARBITRATION RULES AND GOVERNING LAW.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
 
ARBITRATION PROCESS.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Pennsylvania and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
 
ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE.
Unless you and WeTrain otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and WeTrain submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 
ARBITRATOR'S DECISION.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. WeTrain will not seek, and hereby waives all rights WeTrain may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if WeTrain prevails in arbitration.
 
FEES.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, WeTrain will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
 
CHANGES.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if WeTrain changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing WeTrain written notice of such rejection by email from the email address associated with your Account to support@wetrainphilly.com within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last update" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and WeTrain in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
 
7. OTHER PROVISIONS
